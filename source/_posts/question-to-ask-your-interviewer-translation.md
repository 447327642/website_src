## 如何向面试官提问

> Last time, we talked about how to design a technical interview as a filter, starting primarily with determining what sort of person is “good”. This time, I’m turning the tables to look at the other side of things. Let’s talk about some questions you can use to determine if a company is where you want to work. The tech world is a seller’s market for talent. It’s difficult to get a good read on a company from the information you have pre-interview. Companies of all shapes and sizes want to throw you through their gauntlet. Some interviewers will say whatever it takes to get you to sign, others look at their company with rose-tinted glasses. Neither will help you find a job you’ll love. Most questions are easily dodged (“What’s the worst part of this job?”, “There’s too much to do but you’ll fix that!”).

上次，我们从如何判断什么算“好”的技术人员，讨论了如何通过技术面试筛选求职者。这一次，我们转换角色，来谈谈一些你可以用来决定你是否想在某个公司工作。科技界是卖方市场。在面试前，从你了解的信息中很难对一个公司有准确的认识。形形色色各种公司都为你设置了重重关卡。一些面试官为了让你签字而信口开河，另一些则是对公司进行了美化。他们都无法帮你找到你喜爱的工作。多数问题很容易避开，比如，“这个工作哪方面不太好？”，“工作比较重但是你一定能搞定。”

> On the other hand, an attentive interviewer will se these questions as a positive - you’re the sort of person who thinks things through and knows what they’re after. This also helps the interviewer determine what you’re looking for and tailor the rest of the interview to that.

另一方面，一个细心的面试官认为这些问题是加分项--因为你是那种认真思考事情来龙去脉的人。这也帮助面试官了解你的诉求并并对接下来的面试进行相应调整。

### Why general questions fail 为什么普通问题不可行

> Many traditional questions fall short because the interviewer isn’t incentivised to provide a candid answer. Consider: “Do you trust management?” “Trust” is a strong word with some emotional charge. If the interviewer expresses doubts, that may be enough to kill the candidate’s interest altogether. No one wants to be the person who lost a promising candidate, so a little white lie emerges. “Sure!” they say. Two months into the job you realize they actually meant you could trust management to get paychecks in on time (and not much else).

许多传统问题的不足之处在于面试官并不能够坦白回答。试想一下“你信任管理人员吗”这个问题。信任是一个情感色彩较强的词汇。没人想让自己损失一名优秀的候选人，所以一些善意的谎言就出现了。面试官回答是“当然信任啊”。入职两个月后你才猛然醒悟其实他们指的是信任管理人员会按时发工资，再无其他。

> Instead, use a specific question or ask something general and drill down for details. In the above example we could instead ask “What is your management’s vision?” This doesn’t cover all of the bases we had previously but the answer is more likely to be actionable. It tells us how good leaders are at communicating where they want to go. It gives a window into the future of the company - do they just want to get bought? Is there just vague “Change the world” promises?
Many engineers can optimistically gloss over problems.

相反地，使用具体的问题或者问一些宽泛的问题然后追问细节。在上面的例子中，我们可以换作问“管理人员对未来的展望”。这个问题虽不能完全等价于先前的问题，但是答案往往更具行动性。它告诉我们领导们是否善于传达他们的目标。它为我们了解公司前景提供了一个窗口--他们只想被收购？还是只有“改变世界”这样含糊的说词？

许多工程师们会以乐观的说辞搪塞问题。

> Q: How does your team overcome challenges?
A: I believe in clear, open communication and have noticed that in general everyone at Initech seems to as well. Transparency has helped my team overcome obstacles and move forward together.

问：你的团队如何战胜挑战？

答：我信任清晰和敞开的沟通，Initech 中的每一位员工都信奉这一点。透明帮助我的团队克服困难、共同前进。

> Q: Can you give me an example of your team overcoming a difficult obstacle recently?
A: Well, I guess we talk about blockers at our daily standups.

问：你能给我举个你们团队最近克服困难的例子吗？

答：好吧，我想我们大概是在聊我们每天站立会议都会讨论的困难。

> Getting concrete examples means you get past the marketing fluff to a company’s real values.

得到具体的例子表明你透过市场的表象深入到了公司的真正内在。

### Finding red flags 发现潜在问题

> What are you hoping I’ll change?

问：你希望我为公司带来什么改变？

> There are two things I’m looking for in this question: another angle on the job description and wishful thinking. Job descriptions tell part of the story. Now that you’re in for an interview, it’s time to get the other half. This is a great time to talk about potential projects, advancement, and how you in particular will fit in. If the interview seems tense, asking this question can lighten the mood a bit. On the other hand, I’ve often heard things like “Tests are important but we don’t have them. We’re hoping you’ll be able to help out with that.” Did you catch the wishful thinking there? If tests are important then the team should already have a test suite. The interviewer is expecting you to change the company culture without any power to do so. The interviewer isn’t twirling their moustache Snidely Whiplash-style, expecting massive change from a new hire - it’s just the optimism that curses every engineer.

我想从这个问题中了解两点：另一个角度的职位描述和可能存在的过分期待。

职位描述只是一方面。既然你正身处面试之中，是时候了解另一半了。这是一个探讨未来项目、晋升机会以及你在其中的确切角色的大好机会。如果面试很紧张，问这个问题可以让你的心情稍微放松一些。

另一方面，我时常听到像这样的回答“测试很重要但是我们一直没有。我们希望你能帮我们解决。”你意识到对你的期待了吗？如果测试很重要，那团队肯定早就写好了一套测试。面试官希望你不费吹灰之力就改变公司的文化。面试官不是一边狞笑着卷着自己的小胡子（译者注：Snidely Whiplash指的是动画片里坏人，他有弯弯的胡子），一边期望一个新员工能让整个公司焕然一新--而事实上这只是诅咒着每个工程师的乐观主义。

> How often are you pulled off your primary task?

问：你每隔多久会偏离主要的工作内容？

> It seems obvious that someone with the title of “Software Engineer” would spend most of their time engineering software. In some places, a more accurate title would be “meeting attender who writes code on occasion.” Other places expect developers to expand beyond their role, creating their own wireframes or deployment strategies. Even worse, your job requirements could change dramatically. A startup hired one of my friends as a full-stack engineer and he spent most of his time managing ad campaigns on social networks.

显而易见，具有“软件工程师”头衔的人应该把大部分时间花在开发软件上。然而在一些地方，“偶尔写代码的与会人员”才是更准确地称号。另一些地方则是期待开发者们能延伸自己的职责，创建自己的框图和部署策略。更糟糕的情况是，你的工作需求可能会发生巨大的变化。一个创业公司雇佣我的一个朋友当全栈工程师，结果他把大部分时间花在管理社交网络上的广告战上去了。

### Technical 技术

> How does your development process work?

问：你们的开发流程是怎样的？

> This question is essentially a simple Joel test. Lack of source control, tests & code review are all smells that shouldn’t nix the company altogether but will need consideration.

这个问题本质上是个简单的[Joel测试](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html)。缺少版本控制、测试和代码审查都警示着你，即使不完全放弃这家公司，也需要仔细斟酌一番。

> How does your deployment process work?

问：你们部署代码的流程是怎洋的？

> I once joined a company without asking this question and to my dismay discovered the answer was “ssh into all of our servers (one by one) and manually copy/paste the files”. This should be a gimme for any modern company.

我曾有一次没有问这个问题就加入了一个公司。我十分沮丧地发现，问题的答案竟然是“逐个ssh到所有的服务器中，手动复制粘贴文件。”这应该是任何一家现代公司都不会真的做的事。

> A basic deployment process should be: 1. able to roll back；2. easy to see what changed；3. deterministic. Even `git pull` suffices here (though only as a bare minimum).

一个基本的部署流程应该是，能够回滚，能够发现有什么变化，确定的。`git pull`姑且不算，这仅仅是最低要求。

> The last person who was fired - why did that happen? Do you think it was for a reason other than the official one?

问：最近被裁掉的那个人是因为什么被裁了？你认为除了官方原因之外，还有别的隐情吗？

> This is tricky and I wouldn’t ask it at every interview (in fact, I received pushback on it from almost every reviewer). Often there’s some difference between the official reason for a firing (if management provides one at all) and what the rank and file suspect. Other times it’s “This guy was a total jackhole” - a great sign that management is willing to prune a branch for the benefit of the tree. If “firing” seems a step too far, substitute “disciplined” or the like.

这个问题很具有技巧性，我不会在每个面试中都问。实际上，基本每个面试官都把这个问题扔还给我了。通常裁员的官方原因（如果管理者给出了）和阶级以及文件带来的猜想总有些不同之处。其他时候的理由则是“这人是个混蛋”--管理者想为了树好而修枝剪叶。

若是开除太过严重了，可以用批评之类的词。

> What tools does your team use to communicate?

问：你们团队用什么工具交流？

> For virtually all information, async communication methods trump synchronous ones. Async tools like chat, bug trackers, email and the like send information so that the receiver can pick it up on their own time. Synchronous communication (face-to-face) means that someone’s going to get interrupted. It also means that remote workers often get pulled out of the loop.

对于事实上所有信息，异步通信都胜过同步通信。异步工具比如对话、错误追踪、邮件和其他发送信息的方式使得接收者可以自己决定接收时间。同步通信（面对面沟通）意味着有一方得被打扰。同时意味着远程工作者常被强制退出。

> A good follow up is “How was the last big announcement handled?” It’s common for upper management to flub communication and expect the telephone line to make sure everyone’s properly informed. Big events where everyone gets the same info (or heck, even an email blast) are important.

你可以接着问“上个重要的通知是怎么处理的？”上层管理人员扰乱通讯并诉诸于电话线来确保每个人都被通知到了的行为是很普遍的。确保每个人都知道（或者，甚至是邮件轰炸）的大事件是非常重要的。

### Culture 文化

> Imagine a realm where we’re expected to make decisions on a daily or weekly basis. Let’s say you and I disagree on an important decision. We can’t reach a consensus and have to agree to disagree. What then? Whose approach wins?

想想一个场景，我们需要每天或者每周作出决定。假设你跟我在一个重要决定上产生了分歧。我们找不到一个中庸的办法，要么同意，要么不同意。接下来会发生什么？谁会最终取得胜利？

> Here we’re measuring how autocratic our potential employer is. Flatness is the hip thing to be these days and companies want to show off how much autonomy their engineers get. You want to dig beyond the dazzle. If the answer seems flaky, ask for a real-life example. It’s a red flag if the interviewer has trouble coming up with an example that fits the company’s claims.

这里我们是在测试我们的潜在雇主有多独裁。扁平化最近很流行，公司们都想展示他们的工程师所拥有的自主权。而你在炫目的表象下探求真实。如果答案不可靠，就要一个真实生活的例子。如果面试官很难举出一个满足公司宣扬的种种的例子，这就是一个警示。

> What does it take to succeed at this company beyond “hard work”?

问：除了努力工作之外，如何在公司中做出一番业绩？

> We’re trying to separate the marketing from the real culture. Virtually every interviewer will start their answer with chaff like “hard work, being smart, writing good code”. Go deeper and find the difference between “general expectations” and what this company uniquely wants from you. Good answers will be specific. Great answers will be tailored to you as a candidate.

我们努力将营销从实际文化中剥离。实际上每个面试官都会从“努力工作、够聪明，代码质量好”这些无价值的方面开始回答。深入探究，找到“普遍期望”和对你的特殊期望的不同之处。好的答案是具体明确的。更好的答案是为你量身定做的。

> If I’m not meeting expectations, how will I know?

问：如果我无法满足公司对我的预期，我怎么知道呢？

> You can’t improve without feedback of both kinds. I’ve worked at companies that would rather an engineer drag along, closing tickets than dare to ask them to improve and risk them leaving. Others can be sudden - quick firings without much warning. You’re looking for a company with a culture of candid feedback. Everything works better when people are honest with each other. A workplace that values consistent, high-quality feedback means you’ll improve your technical skillset and be surrounded by constantly-improving folks.

如果双方都没有反馈，你是无法进步的。我曾就职于一些宁愿让工程师将错就错也不敢要求他们提升、担心他们辞职的公司。其他公司可能是不给太多警告就突然迅速裁人。你要找能够坦白地给与你反馈的公司。当人与人之间真诚相待，事情才能做得更好。提倡持续的高品质的反馈的工作地点意味着你将会提升自己的技术水平并有一群不断进步的同伴。

> How will I get better at my job?

问：在工作中我如何提升？

> There’s a lot of great answers to this question: training budget, conferences, Friday tech talks, mentoring program (and more!). A good answer is anything beyond a shrug or minor platitudes. In those cases it’s very likely you’ll be left to your own devices in improving.

对这个问题有很多很好的答案：培训预算、峰会、周五的技术讲座、导师项目等等。好的答案远不止一个耸肩或者是短小的老生常谈。这些情况下，你很有可能需要自求他法。

> Finally, the most important question of all:

最后，最重要的一个问题：

> The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over. But it can’t. Not without your help. But you’re not helping.

乌龟壳朝下躺着，肚子被太阳炙烤，四肢挣扎着努力自己翻过来。但是一直没成功。没有你的帮助，永远不会成功。但你并没有在帮它。

> It’s important to work with empathetic people who aren’t murderous replicants.

和富有同情心而不是残忍的杀人魔一起工作是十分重要的。

> You probably don’t want to use all of these questions at every interview. I hope I’ve helped you re-think how to interview a company. Think I missed something? Let me know!

在一场面试中你可能不会用到所有问题。我希望我让你重新思考了如何面试一家公司。如果我疏忽了什么，欢迎指正。
